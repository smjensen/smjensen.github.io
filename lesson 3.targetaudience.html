        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>As stated on our homepage, anyone who lives in Eastern Idaho knows that just because the weather looks 
            clear when you start a journey does not mean that you will be traveling in livable, non dangerous conditions
             five minutes after beginning their journey. If these citizens had a weather map, they could see what their 
             journey would include and plan accordingly.

            <p>•	Occasionally, little Joe will need to walk home. This is not a problem for the 1-2 months that Eastern
                 Idaho is a pleasant place to live, but for the rest of the year, when the weather is unpredictable but 
                 ranges from gold to the 10th circle of hell, a website that can help plot little Joe’s survival for the 
                 day would be welcome.</p>

            <h2>Their physical, social, and technological environment</h2>	
            <p>•	Occasionally, Jacques’ son has to walk home when work goes long. This secretly pleases Jacques. He remembers 
                that when he was Joe’s age, he almost always had to walk to and from school. He remembers vividly trudging through
                 the snow. Uphill. 14 miles. Both ways. Somewhere inside of him, he thinks his son soft for complaining and takes 
                 joy in looking up the weather on a given day and picturing his son walking in the storms.</p>
