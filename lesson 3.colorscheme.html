        <h1>Color Scheme</h1>
        <p>I initially chose my colors based off of a potential banner picture that I dug up. Things 
            got altered a bit over time, but overall the colors have stayed fairly true. I stuck with 
            colors that are liked typically by men and women and did a combination of soothing and
            energizing colors. 
        </p>
        

        <p>From that picture I wanted something contrasting, but that still fit for my main color.</p>
        <img src="images/main color.png" alt="main color image">

        <p>I tend to feel like just solid white is too bright for my eyes on the computer so I picked 
            a neutral off white instead. Something still bright, but not painful to look at or that will
            blind you in the dark.
        </p>

        <p>Next I wanted something to contrast for used links that would show up well on both 
            the potential banner and the main screen. It didn't need to be much different 
            from the main text color. Just enough to notice.</p>

        <p>Last I wanted to pick another color that would contrast well between everything. This 
            is the one color that I am  bit iffy on. I struggled with picking a blue, yellow or 
            green but knew that I wanted something from the banner for it. It would be used 
            sparingly as an accent color, but the wrong one could look odd.
