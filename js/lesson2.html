        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
       <h3> Ford Motor Co.
           <br><a href="https://www.ford.com/" target="_blank">https://www.ford.com/</a></h3><br>
            <img src="https://ford-h.assetsadobe.com/is/image/content/dam/brand_ford/en_us/brand/suvs-crossovers/mache/dm/21_FRD_MCH_48103.tif?croppathe=1_21x9&wid=2160" alt="Ford" class="responsive">
            <p>Ford must have some good photographers because they give an excellent example of the rule of
                thirds. Say what you want about the quality of their cars, this demonstrates that a photo with
                a specific amount of empty space next to the object in question (in this case, a car) will draw 
                even more attention to the object.

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <h3>Mastercard<br> <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html" target="_blank">https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html</a></h3><br>
        <img src="https://www.mastercard.us/content/mccom-admin/referenced-content-placeholder/related-content-about/_jcr_content/contentpar/related_content_item_1671389868/image.adaptive.full.high.jpg/1546643411783.jpg" alt="mastercard" class="responsive">
        
        <p>Mastercard's logo is a perfct example of contrast. Most of the time, contrast highlights the 
            simplicity of design elements, and mastercard is no exception. The black background with the 
            simple two tones of the designes crossing instantly makes anyone who knows of mastercard to think of the 
            product in question.

        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>Walmart<br><a href="https://www.walmart.com/" target="_blank">https://www.walmart.com/</a></h3><br>
        <img src="https://d15z7dtgvh220z.cloudfront.net/images/blog/walmart-screenshot3.png" alt="Walmart" class="responsive">
       
        <p>A visual hierarchy is designed to help the user see a large amount of information in a short period of time.
            Because Walmart wants users to buy their products, they are a great example of a company that is working very hard to 
            implement the visual hierarchy to carry our eyes across all of their products.
